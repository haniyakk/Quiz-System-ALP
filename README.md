## FEATURES
• 🪪 User Registration: Enter name and registration number using buffered input.<br>
• 🎯 Core Functionality: Attempt quizzes, real-time answer validation, and score calculation.<br>
• ⏱️ Timed Evaluation: Fixed time limit per question using BIOS timer interrupts.<br>
• 📊 Score Management: Separate score tracking for each quiz with result display.<br>
• 👤 Profile Management: View and edit user details during execution.<br>
• 📋 Menu Driven Interface: Structured navigation using loops and conditional branching.<br>
• 🛡️ Input Validation: Multiple-choice based controlled input to prevent invalid entries.<br>

Used for keyboard input, screen output, and timing operations.<br>

## INSTALLATION
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:  

### 1. Open EMU8086  
Load the `.asm` file in EMU8086 emulator.

### 2. Compile and Run  
Compile and execute the program directly inside the emulator.

## USAGE 
➡️ Enter your name and registration number at program start.<br>
➡️ Navigate through the main menu to start quiz, view score, edit profile, or exit.<br>
➡️ Answer multiple-choice questions using a/b/c/d keys.<br>
➡️ Each question must be answered within the given time limit.<br>
➡️ Scores are calculated in real time and displayed after quiz completion.<br>
➡️ Return to main menu or exit the program gracefully.<br>

## DISCLAIMER  
  
This project is a **non-commercial academic model**, created for learning and demonstration purposes only. It was developed as part of the **Computer Organization and Assembly Language Lab (CEL-323)** coursework.  

• Implemented purely in **8086 Assembly Language**  
• Demonstrates low-level concepts such as interrupts, memory segmentation, loops, and procedures  
• User data and scores are stored **temporarily in memory**  

This project is not intended for production or commercial use.
